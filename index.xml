      <description>Evaluations “Dr. Feldman has made MDM small groups extremely interactive, and I feel as though I really learn the material both by preparing for these sessions and due to his teaching/review of concepts.” “Dr. Feldman was an excellent MDM leader; he provided examples of times he used MDM principles in treating actual patients, and did a great job of explaining principles which the group didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.” “Dr. Feldman does a great job in guiding our group through the assignment, emphasizing the important aspects and relating it to what is clinically relevant in reality.</description>

      <description>I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I went to medical school in Chicago and fell in love with the city, although Philadelphia is growing on me since August 2017. When I’m not seeing patients or teaching, I like enjoy running, biking, cooking, finding a new ethnic restaurant, and sharing fun (anonymous, HIPAA-friendly) stories of funny, interesting, memorable patients. Medium-term, I would like to be course director of basic immunology for first-year medical students, and allergy/immunology fellowship program director.</description>
