      <title>Fellows Immunology Course</title>

      <description>I developed this course modeled after my immunology training in fellowship. Instructional methodology employs a flipped classroom with active learning via worksheets prior to sessions, with learning sessions focused on discussing material, addressing questions, and exploring some topics in greater depth. Topics are generally organized in the order of the textbook. Currently I am the main instructor as well, leading about 80% of the sessions. As the course grows and repeats, I anticipate senior fellows leading sessions, and expanding to include other faculty who feel comfortable leading the discussion of any topics.</description>

Learner Evaluations “Dr. Feldman has made MDM small groups extremely interactive, and I feel as though I really learn the material both by preparing for these sessions and due to his teaching/review of concepts.”
“Dr. Feldman was an excellent MDM leader; he provided examples of times he used MDM principles in treating actual patients, and did a great job of explaining principles which the group didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.</description>

      <description>I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I went to medical school in Chicago and fell in love with the city, although Philadelphia is growing on me since August 2017. When I’m not seeing patients or teaching, I like enjoy running, biking, cooking, finding a new ethnic restaurant, and sharing fun (anonymous, HIPAA-friendly) stories of funny, interesting, memorable patients. Medium-term, I would like to be course director of basic immunology for first-year medical students, and allergy/immunology fellowship program director.</description>

      <description>As a Fellow at Northwestern, I developed a five-part video series for a “flipped classroom” where students watched lectures before in-person sections designed to reinforce what they had learned and give immediate feedback on their understanding of the material.
This is the Online Module
These are the videos I created with Lightboard embedded within the above online module.
Antibodies and Isotypes What do antibodies do? (04:35)
 Lymphocyte Development How do B cells develop?</description>
