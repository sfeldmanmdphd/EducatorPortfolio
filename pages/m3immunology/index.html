<p>As a Fellow at Northwestern, I developed a five-part video series for a “flipped classroom” where students watched lectures before in-person sections designed to reinforce what they had learned and give immediate feedback on their understanding of the material.</p>

<li>“Dr. Feldman’s lectures were very organized and effective. I really enjoyed his lecturing style. “</li>
<li>“Dr. Feldman was a fantastic and engaging lecturer. His lectures were very well organized and were delivered in an appropriate pace. I really enjoyed his lectures and appreciate him highlighting the main take away points from his lectures so we were not buried under small details. I wish he will give more lectures in the future. “</li>
<li>“I really enjoyed Dr. Feldman&rsquo;s lectures and how he guided our studying by telling us what topics we should focus on for the FDN 3 exam. His lectures were clear and presented with confidence. I hope we have more sessions with Dr. Feldman in the future. “</li>
<li>“Dr. Feldman did a really good job with his immunology lectures. He was engaging and reassured us that we would not have to know all the little details yet. He made it clear what was important for us to know at this point. His powerpoint was very well put together and easy to follow along with in class.”</li>
<li>“I feel that you did a very good job of incorporating the scope of the topics that you wanted to discuss with the clinical cases you used as examples. You had a very nice framework for each lecture that allowed you to still mention more detailed topics without having to justify their presence as an example or for the sake of being thorough. “</li>
<li>“Dr. Feldman was of the most articulate lecturers in the immunology series. His presentation was clear, clinically relevant, and memorable.”</li>
<li>“You had excellent lectures - the slides were all well organized, and I really appreciated that you said ahead of time what to really focus on. You were also a great presenter, and learning guides were good.”</li>

    <ul>
<li>“These lectures were great! Dr. Feldman was one of the best lecturers of the immunology section. The goals at the beginning of each lecture were incredibly helpful, as were the clinical cases. The key concepts were easy to follow and heavily emphasized, which made the information easy to remember. More lectures by Dr. Feldman would be great. “
“The best lecturer we had this module. He taught from the stand point of a student - he clearly listed the important topics that we had to know for the exam, and provided questions to test our understanding. I wish all faculty did both of these things so clearly! “
“I don’t remember what Dr. Feldman talked to us about”
“Dr. Feldman was one of the clearest and most engaging lecturers we had this module. I hope that in the future he teaches more of this module in place of some of the other lecturers! “
“Very organized. Had no idea he was a resident. This was the most effective immunology lecturer.”
“Dr. Feldman was awesome!! Please have him back! he made allergy digestible and pointed out what was relevant to us vs. what was higher level, which i really appreciated.”
“I thought Dr. Feldman was an excellent lecturer! He was very clear and communicated challenging topics very well.”</li>
