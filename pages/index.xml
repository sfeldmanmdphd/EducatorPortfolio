      <description>I developed this course modeled after my immunology training in fellowship. Instructional methodology employs a flipped classroom with active learning via worksheets prior to sessions, with learning sessions focused on discussing material, addressing questions, and exploring some topics in greater depth. Topics are generally organized in the order of the textbook. Currently I am the main instructor as well, leading about 80% of the sessions. As the course grows and repeats, I anticipate senior fellows leading sessions, and expanding to include other faculty who feel comfortable leading the discussion of any topics.</description>

Learner Evaluations “Dr. Feldman has made MDM small groups extremely interactive, and I feel as though I really learn the material both by preparing for these sessions and due to his teaching/review of concepts.”
“Dr. Feldman was an excellent MDM leader; he provided examples of times he used MDM principles in treating actual patients, and did a great job of explaining principles which the group didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.</description>

      <description>As a Fellow at Northwestern, I developed a five-part video series for a “flipped classroom” where students watched lectures before in-person sections designed to reinforce what they had learned and give immediate feedback on their understanding of the material.
This is the Online Module
These are the videos I created with Lightboard embedded within the above online module.

      <description>Since joining the faculty at Unversity of Pennsylvania, I co-led an M1 Immunology small group for 6 session in the fall of 2017. 18 students led themselves through immunology cases prepared by the course directors, and I facilitated discussion of the material.
In the fall of 2016, I was an instructor in the Basic Immunology course for M1 students at Northwestern University Medical School. I gave the large group lectures on Effector Functions of Humoral Immunity, Mucosal Immunology, and Immunity to Microbes to the class of ~150 students, who either showed up and/or watched online.</description>
