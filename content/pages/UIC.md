In summer 2017, to celebrat the 10-year anniversary of my MD/PhD training program obtaining NIH-funding as an MSTP, I was invited to give the keynote address at this program, with a dinner seminar for the students. I used the opportunity to highlight why I chose my specialty with real clinical cases, review some unanswered research questions, discuss some recent groundbreaking papers in therapeutics and management, and finally to demonstrate and role model some techniques in medical education.
