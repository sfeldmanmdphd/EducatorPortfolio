As a Fellow at Northwestern, I worked on a medical education project to apply the principles of adult learning theory and active learning by integrating basic immunology content with asynchoronous web-based learning technology. I developed a five-part video series for a “flipped classroom” where students watched lectures before in-person sections designed to reinforce what they had learned and give immediate feedback on their understanding of the material. 
This was implemented at Northwestern University in the Fall of 2016, and I am working with my mentor Dr. Marianne Green to study both the efficacy of this novel teaching methodology and student satisfaction. We plan to publish the results.

This is the Online Module that students are sent.

This is an example of a video I created with [Lightboard](http://lightboard.info/) embedded within the above online module.

## Qualitative Feedback
“I thought this was a very solid way to present this information. The topic is very broad, though, so I was sometimes lost by the details. It seems quite difficult to get all of this material into a short primer like this, but it was done effectively enough for me to learn some of the key points” 

"I think this would be an interesting session for individuals interested in immunology."

“I prefer to do this in class; not a good individual study format.”
