As faculty at Penn, I was invited to give a noon conference for the interns and residents in the internal medicine residency program. I selected a topic for which we commonly received consults, and then developed cases, MKSAP-style multiple choice questions, and a presentation, and then led an educational session. The slides are below. This session began in 2018, and was repeated in 2019 for mulitple noon conferences.
