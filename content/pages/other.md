## Miscellaneous Older Curriculum Development

### Co-founder, Medical Education Track, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  
<dt>2013-2015</dt>  
I worked with Vice Chair for Education Dr. David Thomas to develop a Medical Education Track for the Internal Medicine Residency Program at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I developed a curriculum outline and assessment methods, and facilitated implementation of a pilot track year beginning in July 2015 (after my completion of residency). The [track](http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/residencies-fellowships/list/msh-internal-medicine-residency/education/categorical) is still active under the leadership of Dr. Thomas and Dr. Andy Coyle.

### Co-creator, Back-To-M3 Course, UIC College of Medicine  
<dt>2010</dt>  
In the final graduate school year of my MD/PhD program, I co-created a transition course for MSTP students who were transitioning back to the medical school years (year 3). I worked with 2 other MSTP students to organize a curriculum, develop and organize lectures, and designed an implemented evaluations. The course has repeated annually since 2010, undergoing revisions as it proceeded.

## Miscellaneous Direct Teaching: Lectures and Small Groups

### Small group leader, Essentials of Clinical Medicine MSTP group, UIC College of Medicine  
<dt>2011-2012</dt>  
Along with the faculty leader and MSTP Director Dr. Larry Tobacman, I led the group of about 12 first and second year MSTP students in 8 total 2-hour sessions on various topics from Basic Biostastics to Informed Consent.

### Instructor, Providing Healthcare to your LGBT Patients, UIC College of Medicine  
<dt>2008-2012</dt>  
Along with 1 or 2 other student instructors, I led 4 2-3 hours sessions with about 12 first-year medical students who enrolled in this elective as part of the umbrella Essential of Clinical Medicine course. We reviewed current literature and discussed topics unique to caring for LGBT patients.

### Teaching Assistant, Graduate Immunology, UIC College of Medicine  
<dt>2008</dt>  
For one semester, I assisted my research mentor Dr. Amy Kenter who was the course director. I attended the weekly sessions, helped answer questions outside of class, and reviewed/graded the journal article critiques that students worked on as a part of the course.

### Peer Reviewer/Tutor, Histology for First-Year Medical Students, UIC College of Medicine  
<dt>2006-2012</dt>  
Each of the first year basic science courses had senior medical students who reviewed the material in preparation for upcoming exam. For six year, I led 3 2-3 hour sessions per year to review the topics in histology.
