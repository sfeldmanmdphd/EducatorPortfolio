## Miscellaneous Older Curriculum Development
<dt>2013-2015</dt>
### Co-founder, Medical Education Track, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
I worked with Vice Chair for Education Dr. David Thomas to develop a Medical Education Track for the Internal Medicine Residency Program at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I developed a curriculum outline and assessment methods, and facilitated implementation of a pilot track year beginning in July 2015 (after my completion of residency). The [track](http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/residencies-fellowships/list/msh-internal-medicine-residency/education/categorical) is still active under the leadership of Dr. Thomas and Dr. Andy Coyle.

### Co-creator, Back-To-M3 Course, UIC College of Medicine
In the final graduate school year of my MD/PhD program, I co-created a transition course for MSTP students who were transitioning back to the medical school years (year 3). I worked with 2 other MSTP students to organize a curriculum, develop and organize lectures, and designed an implemented evaluations. The course has repeated annually since 2010, undergoing revisions as it proceeded.

### Teaching Assistant, Graduate Immunology, UIC College of Medicine
For one semester, I assisted my research mentor Dr. Amy Kenter who was the course director. I attended the weekly sessions, helped answer questions outside of class, and reviewed/graded the journal article critiques that students worked on as a part of the course.

### Peer Reviewer/Tutor, Histology for First-Year Medical Students, UIC College of Medicine
