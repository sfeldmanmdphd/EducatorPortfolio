I developed this course modeled after my immunology training in fellowship. Instructional methodology employs a flipped classroom with active learning via worksheets prior to sessions, with learning sessions focused on discussing material, addressing questions, and exploring some topics in greater depth. Topics are generally organized in the order of the textbook. Currently I am the main instructor as well, leading about 80% of the sessions. As the course grows and repeats, I anticipate senior fellows leading sessions, and expanding to include other faculty who feel comfortable leading the discussion of any topics.

A Sample Quiz question (written by me)  
  A 25 yo F comes to clinic after having her DNA sequenced on 23andme.com. She has been very stressed as, among many things, it showed she has a “mutation in the J chain.” She wants to know how this will affect her health.  
  Which disease would be LEAST likely to develop in this patient?  
  *a) Celiac disease  
  b) Clostridium Difficile colitis  
  c) Crohn’s disease  
  d) Food allergy*

#### Learner Feedback
