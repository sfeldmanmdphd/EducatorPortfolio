I developed this course modeled after my immunology training in fellowship. Instructional methodology employs a flipped classroom with active learning via worksheets prior to sessions, with learning sessions focused on discussing material, addressing questions, and exploring some topics in greater depth. Topics are generally organized in the order of the textbook. Currently I am the main instructor as well, leading about 80% of the sessions. As the course grows and repeats, I anticipate senior fellows leading sessions, and expanding to include other faculty who feel comfortable leading the discussion of any topics.

#### Learner Feedback    
  Evaluation Comments (2017-2018):  
  â€œToday was great! I snapchatted 'immunology fun' over my thymus cartoon I drew on the board!"  
  "It is a great idea to present the topics as a work sheet to master."  
  "Quiz was very helpful to get a flavor of what ABAI immuno questions would be like and also see what concepts I didn't understand/remember. Liked the outlines. A much better alternative than reading the textbook line by line, which frankly, SUCKS."  
  "I think the course is incredible helpful"  
  "Thank you for all your hard work in getting this course started! The textbook is very dense, so these sessions help break it apart in a more understandable manner."  
  "Quiz should be self graded. Grade should be irrelevant. For worksheets it would be helpful to point out relevant tables per question to help pinpoint reading for those unable to read full chapter each week but do have time for a pointed review."
