As faculty at Penn, I was invited to create and give a lecture on immune deficiencies and pulmonary disease for the pulmonary fellows "Summer Lecture Series" for new and continuing fellows. Both pulmonary fellows and faculty attended.  
The slides are below.

"This is the first we have had a lecture like this and it was spectacular. Incredibly relevant, in fact while listening to it I thought 'how is it possible that we haven't been getting this lecture every year, forever?'. Not only was the information presented succinct and relevant, but it was presented in a clear and accessible manner."

"This lecture is a great addition to the SLS!"

"Really liked the question script for PID (primary immunodeficiency)"

"Great! Would like to hear more about anaphylaxis"

"More cases"

"Great!"

"Great talk!"

"This was awesome"
