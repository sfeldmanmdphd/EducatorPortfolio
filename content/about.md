I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I went to medical school in Chicago and fell in love with the city, although Philadelphia is growing on me since August 2017. When Iâ€™m not seeing patients or teaching,  I like enjoy running, biking, cooking, finding a new ethnic restaurant, and sharing fun (anonymous, HIPAA-friendly) stories of funny, interesting, memorable patients.
   Medium-term, I would like to be course director of basic immunology for first-year medical students, and allergy/immunology fellowship program director. Long-term, I would like to explore institutional leadership roles in undergraduate or graduate medical education, such as Dean of Education, with an interest in designing innovative curriculum that takes into account current practices and technology (e.g. smartphones).
