      <description>At Northwestern University in the fall of 2016 and the spring of 2017, I led a small group for first-year medical students as part of the Medical Decision Making course. I had 3 different groups of 10-12 students, each for 5 sessions on average every other week (then instructors would rotate groups). Topics included Diagnostics, Advanced Decision Making, Case Control and Cohorts, Risk Harm and Association, Prognosis, Screening, Threshold Actions, Clinical Prediction Rules, Decision Analysis, Cost Effective Analysis, Guidelines &amp;amp; Policy.</description>
